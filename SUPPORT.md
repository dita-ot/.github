# DITA-OT Support

DITA-OT is maintained by a [small group of volunteers][1] who work on the project in their spare time.

With these limited resources, we can't offer direct support, but the DITA community offers several other forums, including:

- The [DITA-OT project website][2] at [dita-ot.org][2] provides information about the latest toolkit releases, including [download links][3], release notes, and [documentation][4] for recent DITA-OT versions.
- The [DITA Users group][5] was founded in 2004 as a Yahoo! Group and moved to Groups.io in November 2019. The mailing list addresses the needs of DITA users at all levels of experience, from beginners to experts, and serves as a vital resource for the DITA community.
- The [DITA-OT Users Google Group][6] is a general interest DITA-OT product forum, for questions on any aspect of the toolkit â€” from installation and getting started to questions about specific overrides, plug-ins, and customizations.
- The StackOverflow developer community includes [topics related to DITA-OT][7].
